##### *by [@korstan](https://github.com/korstan)*


## What's this?
My snippets for Visual Studio Code IDE. It's useful to have all of them in one place, accessable everywhere I go.

## Repo structure
All snippets are grouped by langs/libs(frameworks) in folders of the same name. Feel free to use the ones for your technologies if you find them useful.
